%description
kLIBC is a C runtime library in which the coder is exploring The Single Unix 
Specification (SUS) and various *BSD, Sun and Linux interfaces used in 'portable'
software. While implementing SUS completely and providing a great range of special
BSD, Sun and Linux APIs is a kind of ultimate goal, the main focus is on what is
interesting to play with and what is requested by porters using kLIBC.
